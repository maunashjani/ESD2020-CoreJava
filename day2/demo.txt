Create a class Bicycle with the following data:

variables: gear, speed
member functions: display(), setGear(), applyBrake(), speedUp()

1. Use constructor to initialize variables.
2. display() to show all data.
3. setGear() to change gear value.
4. applyBrake() to decrement the current speed.
5. speedUp() to increment the current speed.

Then,

Create a class MountainBike class that is a subclass/derived class of Bicycle.

variables: seatHeight
member functions: setHeight()

1. Use constructor to initialize variables also extend from super class.
2. setHeight() to give a value to seatHeight variable.
3. Extend display() method by adding seatHeight data to it.
4. Create object of Bicycle class and call the relevant methods.
5. Create object of MountainBike class and call the relevant methods.
